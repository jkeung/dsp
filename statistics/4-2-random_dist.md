[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise 4.2 
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

'''
import numpy as np
import random
t = [random.random() for x in range(1000)]
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
'''

CDF

'''
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
'''

PMF

'''
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth = 0.1)
'''
